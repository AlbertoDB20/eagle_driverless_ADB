Here are four project ideas for the Eagle Racing Team's recruitment program at the University of Trento, specifically for the Driverless Team Division

Project 1
A rolling shift (or rolling shutter distortion) is a type of image distortion that happens when different parts of the image are captured at slightly different times. This can occur with cameras that use a rolling shutter, a mechanism that captures images line-by-line (typically row by row or column by column) rather than all at once.
